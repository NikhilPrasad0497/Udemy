History: JavaScript first came as LiveScript 1996.

JavaScript is lightweight, cross-platform, Object Oriented Programming Language.
JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of web development.

Client Side : used in Browser.
Server Side : Used in Server side Programming for e.g Node.js 

JavaScript provides:
    1. Dynamic Effects and Interactivity
    2. Modern web applications that we can interact with.

ROLE of JavaScript in web development

HTML : Content (Nouns)
CSS : Presentation (Adjective)
JavaScript : Dynamic Effects/Programming (Verb).

JavaScript Versions:

ECMAScript: the language Standard.
JavaScript: the language in practice.
ES5 (2009) Major Release , ES6/ES2015 (2015) biggest Update ever , ES7, 

PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES:
    1. Numbers: Floating point numbers, for decimals and integers
    2. String: Sequence of characters, used for text
    3. Boolean: Logical data type that can only be True or False.
    4. Undefined: Data type of a variable that does not have a value yet.
    5. Null: Also means 'non-existent'

JavaScript has Dynamic typing : data types are automatically defined in JavaScript.

Type Coersion : conversion of data types from one to another.
Variable Mutation : conversion of value in already defined variable

OPERATOR PRECEDENCE: "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence"

Falsy values: Undefined, Null, 0, '', notNumber
Truthy values: Not Falsy values.

Arrays: collection os variables having different Datatypes.
Objects: [key, value Pair], order does not matter. 

***************What Happens to JS Code***************

Code ---> JS Engine (V8, Reno etc)
          Parser
          Abstract Syntax Tree 
          Conversion to Machine Code
          Code Runs

Environment : for non function variable(Global Execution Context)
              for function variable(Execution Context function())

Priniples of Coding:
DRY : Don't Repeat yourself.


Advance JavaScript:

Object Inheritance and Prototypes: -
1. Every JavaScript Object has a prototype property, which makes inheritance possible in JavaScript.
2. The prototype property of an Object is where we put methods and properties thet we want other objects to inherit.
3. The constructor's prototype property is not the prototypeof the constructor itself, it's the prototype of all instances that are created through it.
4. When a certain method (or property) is called, the search starts in the object itself, and if it cannot be found, the search moves to the object's prototype. This continues untill methods is found : Prototype Chain.
